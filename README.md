### This project will allow you to deploy your python/node application to dokku easily from a web interface

### Features
- one click deployment 
- no additional configurations 
- build to work with both dokku and heroku
- build in CMS


### Release notes:

Project development has been halted. Some features may not work/would require bug fixes.
Dokku daemon handler API was still under early stages of development with potential vulnerabilities and was subsequently the reason why its source code is still closed source.

#### This project serves as a proof of concept for upcoming production-ready platform.
